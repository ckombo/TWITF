"That's What It's There For" (TWITF) is a multimedia artwork that extends my painting of the same name using Augmented Reality *AR) to add digital interactivity, animation, and poetry via a custom app created in Unity.

The painting was done by hand(51 x 40 cm, Acrylic on canvas, 2018), design and animation were done using Photoshop and After effects, respectively; AR interactivity were done using Unity.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1 - Download and Install 'TWITF.apk' on an android phone.
2 - Print 'TWITF-AR-TRIGGER-IMAGE.jpg' on paper.
3 - Open app (give camera permissions, turn up volume), and point camera at AR trigger image.

*Note the app may take some time to load. I'm npt sure why, but will look to reduce the filesize (67 MB) which is most likely down to the contained .png image sequences I used to preserve transparency.
